# KSU 2020 Hackathon

LexisNexis Learn Academy welcomes to KSU 2020 Fall Hackathon.

# Challenge

## Impact of COVID-19 on Aviation

For this challenge you are presented with two pre-scheduled flight datasets. 2019 and 2020 global direct flight schedules. Direct flights are flights from airport A (Departure Station) to airport B (Arrival Station). If you want to look at connection flights from A to B to C, you need to build them, keep in mind arrival/departure time and dates :)

Each flight dataset contains a year of schedules from the month it's established. For example May2020 file will have all schedule flights till May 2021.

Flight data is from our sister company Cirium. For more information please visit
[Cirium](https://www.cirium.com/).

## Tools

Data is already cleaned and loaded into our cluster, it's ready for you just to create a login and start working/coding in our [CloudIDE](https://ide.hpccsystems.com/)
You can find a easy to use user guide under Help in CloudIDE.

Need a visualization tool to create charts and dashboards, RealBI is ready to serve you. It's connected to the same cluster, so no pain of moving your data, just make sure your results are saved in files. You can use RealBI built-in ECL script to aggregate data for visualization on the fly. Just like CloudIDE user-guide is available.

Need sample code to practice, please use [LearnECL](https://ide.hpccsystems.com/workspaces/share/291d17d9-e5cb-4fac-83c2-ac5997c28a31) workspace in CloudIDE.

If you need more information on jobs you are running please use [ECL Watch Page]()

For ease of use, most of materials can be found in this repository as well.
