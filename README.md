# KSU 2020 Hackathon

LexisNexis Learn Academy welcomes to KSU 2020 Fall Hackathon.

# Challenge

## Impact of COVID-19 on Aviation

For this challenge you are presented with two pre-scheduled flight datasets. 2019 and 2020 global direct flight schedules. Direct flights are flights from airport A (Departure Station) to airport B (Arrival Station). If you want to look at connection flights from A to B to C, you need to build them, keep in mind arrival/departure time and dates :)

Each flight dataset contains a year of schedules from the month it's established. For example May2020 file will have all schedule flights till May 2021.

Keep in mind that DiscontinueDate can go over a year, based on how long that flight should operate. For example, a scheduled flight can operate from (EffectiveDate) 06/01/2020 t0 07/23/2023 (DiscontinueDate).

User guide is available under Help in CloudIDE, also can be found in this repository.

[Flights_Workshop](https://ide.hpccsystems.com/workspaces/share/9feee85a-3ceb-4609-a8aa-99959a8a59bc) has the initial code you need for this challenge.

If you need more information on jobs you are running please use [ECL Watch Page](http://40.76.26.67:8010)

[RealBI](http://realbi-hackathon.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com) is the visualization tool for creating charts and dashboards. To start please email your name and email to Chris Human(Christopher.Human@lexisnexisrisk.com) to request login.

RealBI is connected to the same cluster, so no pain of moving your data, just make sure your results are saved in files. You can use RealBI built-in ECL script to aggregate data for visualization on the fly. User guide is available in the application and in this repository.

For a quick start on ECL syntax, please use [Learn ECL](https://hpccsystems-solutions-lab.github.io/). All sample code used in Learn ECL is available [LearnECL workshop](https://ide.hpccsystems.com/workspaces/share/291d17d9-e5cb-4fac-83c2-ac5997c28a31) in CloudIDE.
