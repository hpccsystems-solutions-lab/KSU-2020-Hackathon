# KSU 2020 Hackathon

LexisNexis Learn Academy welcomes to KSU 2020 Fall Hackathon.

# Challenge

## Impact of COVID-19 on Aviation

For this challenge you are presented with two pre-scheduled flight datasets. 2019 and 2020 global direct flight schedules. Direct flights are flights from airport A (Departure Station) to airport B (Arrival Station). If you want to look at connection flights from A to B to C, you need to build them, keep in mind arrival/departure time and dates :)

Each flight dataset contains a year of schedules from the month it's established. For example May2020 file will have all schedule flights till May 2021.

Keep in mind that DiscontinueDate can go over a year, based on how long that flight should operate. For example, a scheduled flight can operate from (EffectiveDate) 06/01/2020 t0 07/23/2023 (DiscontinueDate).

Data is already cleaned and loaded into our cluster, it's ready for you just to create a login and start working/coding in our [CloudIDE](https://ide.hpccsystems.com/)
User guide is in Help tab of CloudIDE, also can be found in this repository.

Your workshop is setup and ready for you to start [coding](https://ide.hpccsystems.com/workspaces/share/9feee85a-3ceb-4609-a8aa-99959a8a59bc).

Need sample code to practice, please use [LearnECL](https://ide.hpccsystems.com/workspaces/share/291d17d9-e5cb-4fac-83c2-ac5997c28a31) workspace in CloudIDE.

If you need more information on jobs you are running please use [ECL Watch Page](http://40.76.26.67:8010)

Need a visualization tool to create charts and dashboards, [RealBI](http://realbi-qa.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/) is ready to serve you.
